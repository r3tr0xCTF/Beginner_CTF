Overview
Multi-layered binary challenge featuring three progressive "wall" defenses that must be breached using titan knowledge and reverse engineering skills. Players must identify the correct titan names to unlock each layer and reveal the final flag.
Features

Anti-debugging measures: ptrace detection, timing analysis, environment checks
Multiple encryption schemes: Position-based XOR, reverse array processing, multi-key encryption
Anti-static analysis: Runtime string construction to hide flag from strings command
Thematic integration: Attack on Titan storyline with authentic character references
Progressive difficulty: Three distinct challenges with increasing complexity.

Skills Demonstrated
